## List items

A [list marker](@) is a
[bullet list marker] or an [ordered list marker].

A [bullet list marker](@)
is a `-`, `+`, or `*` character.

An [ordered list marker](@)
is a sequence of 1--9 arabic digits (`0-9`), followed by either a
`.` character or a `)` character.  (The reason for the length
limit is that with 10 digits we start seeing integer overflows
in some browsers.)

The following rules define [list items]:

1.  **Basic case.**  If a sequence of lines *Ls* constitute a sequence of
    blocks *Bs* starting with a [non-whitespace character], and *M* is a
    list marker of width *W* followed by 1 ≤ *N* ≤ 4 spaces, then the result
    of prepending *M* and the following spaces to the first line of
    *Ls*, and indenting subsequent lines of *Ls* by *W + N* spaces, is a
    list item with *Bs* as its contents.  The type of the list item
    (bullet or ordered) is determined by the type of its list marker.
    If the list item is ordered, then it is also assigned a start
    number, based on the ordered list marker.

    Exceptions:

    1. When the first list item in a [list] interrupts
    a paragraph---that is, when it starts on a line that would
    otherwise count as [paragraph continuation text]---then (a)
    the lines *Ls* must not begin with a blank line, and (b) if
    the list item is ordered, the start number must be 1.
    2. If any line is a [thematic break][thematic breaks] then
       that line is not a list item.

For example, let *Ls* be the lines

```````````````````````````````` example
A paragraph
with two lines.

    indented code

> A block quote.
.
<p>A paragraph
with two lines.</p>
<pre><code>indented code
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>A block quote.</p>
</blockquote>
````````````````````````````````


And let *M* be the marker `1.`, and *N* = 2.  Then rule #1 says
that the following is an ordered list item with start number 1,
and the same contents as *Ls*:

```````````````````````````````` example
1.  A paragraph
    with two lines.

        indented code

    > A block quote.
.
<ol>
<li>
<p>A paragraph
with two lines.</p>
<pre><code>indented code
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>A block quote.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
````````````````````````````````


The most important thing to notice is that the position of
the text after the list marker determines how much indentation
is needed in subsequent blocks in the list item.  If the list
marker takes up two spaces, and there are three spaces between
the list marker and the next [non-whitespace character], then blocks
must be indented five spaces in order to fall under the list
item.

Here are some examples showing how far content must be indented to be
put under the list item:

```````````````````````````````` example
- one

 two
.
<ul>
<li>one</li>
</ul>
<p>two</p>
````````````````````````````````


```````````````````````````````` example
- one

  two
.
<ul>
<li>
<p>one</p>
<p>two</p>
</li>
</ul>
````````````````````````````````


```````````````````````````````` example
 -    one

     two
.
<ul>
<li>one</li>
</ul>
<pre><code> two
</code></pre>
````````````````````````````````


```````````````````````````````` example
 -    one

      two
.
<ul>
<li>
<p>one</p>
<p>two</p>
</li>
</ul>
````````````````````````````````


It is tempting to think of this in terms of columns:  the continuation
blocks must be indented at least to the column of the first
[non-whitespace character] after the list marker. However, that is not quite right.
The spaces after the list marker determine how much relative indentation
is needed.  Which column this indentation reaches will depend on
how the list item is embedded in other constructions, as shown by
this example:

```````````````````````````````` example
   > > 1.  one
>>
>>     two
.
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>one</p>
<p>two</p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
````````````````````````````````


Here `two` occurs in the same column as the list marker `1.`,
but is actually contained in the list item, because there is
sufficient indentation after the last containing blockquote marker.

The converse is also possible.  In the following example, the word `two`
occurs far to the right of the initial text of the list item, `one`, but
it is not considered part of the list item, because it is not indented
far enough past the blockquote marker:

```````````````````````````````` example
>>- one
>>
  >  > two
.
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>one</li>
</ul>
<p>two</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
````````````````````````````````


Note that at least one space is needed between the list marker and
any following content, so these are not list items:

```````````````````````````````` example
-one

2.two
.
<p>-one</p>
<p>2.two</p>
````````````````````````````````


A list item may contain blocks that are separated by more than
one blank line.

```````````````````````````````` example
- foo


  bar
.
<ul>
<li>
<p>foo</p>
<p>bar</p>
</li>
</ul>
````````````````````````````````


A list item may contain any kind of block:

```````````````````````````````` example
1.  foo

    ```
    bar
    ```

    baz

    > bam
.
<ol>
<li>
<p>foo</p>
<pre><code>bar
</code></pre>
<p>baz</p>
<blockquote>
<p>bam</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
````````````````````````````````


A list item that contains an indented code block will preserve
empty lines within the code block verbatim.

```````````````````````````````` example
- Foo

      bar


      baz
.
<ul>
<li>
<p>Foo</p>
<pre><code>bar


baz
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
````````````````````````````````

Note that ordered list start numbers must be nine digits or less:

```````````````````````````````` example
123456789. ok
.
<ol start="123456789">
<li>ok</li>
</ol>
````````````````````````````````


```````````````````````````````` example
1234567890. not ok
.
<p>1234567890. not ok</p>
````````````````````````````````


A start number may begin with 0s:

```````````````````````````````` example
0. ok
.
<ol start="0">
<li>ok</li>
</ol>
````````````````````````````````


```````````````````````````````` example
003. ok
.
<ol start="3">
<li>ok</li>
</ol>
````````````````````````````````


A start number may not be negative:

```````````````````````````````` example
-1. not ok
.
<p>-1. not ok</p>
````````````````````````````````



2.  **Item starting with indented code.**  If a sequence of lines *Ls*
    constitute a sequence of blocks *Bs* starting with an indented code
    block, and *M* is a list marker of width *W* followed by
    one space, then the result of prepending *M* and the following
    space to the first line of *Ls*, and indenting subsequent lines of
    *Ls* by *W + 1* spaces, is a list item with *Bs* as its contents.
    If a line is empty, then it need not be indented.  The type of the
    list item (bullet or ordered) is determined by the type of its list
    marker.  If the list item is ordered, then it is also assigned a
    start number, based on the ordered list marker.

An indented code block will have to be indented four spaces beyond
the edge of the region where text will be included in the list item.
In the following case that is 6 spaces:

```````````````````````````````` example
- foo

      bar
.
<ul>
<li>
<p>foo</p>
<pre><code>bar
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
````````````````````````````````


And in this case it is 11 spaces:

```````````````````````````````` example
  10.  foo

           bar
.
<ol start="10">
<li>
<p>foo</p>
<pre><code>bar
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
````````````````````````````````


If the *first* block in the list item is an indented code block,
then by rule #2, the contents must be indented *one* space after the
list marker:

```````````````````````````````` example
    indented code

paragraph

    more code
.
<pre><code>indented code
</code></pre>
<p>paragraph</p>
<pre><code>more code
</code></pre>
````````````````````````````````


```````````````````````````````` example
1.     indented code

   paragraph

       more code
.
<ol>
<li>
<pre><code>indented code
</code></pre>
<p>paragraph</p>
<pre><code>more code
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
````````````````````````````````


Note that an additional space indent is interpreted as space
inside the code block:

```````````````````````````````` example
1.      indented code

   paragraph

       more code
.
<ol>
<li>
<pre><code> indented code
</code></pre>
<p>paragraph</p>
<pre><code>more code
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
````````````````````````````````


Note that rules #1 and #2 only apply to two cases:  (a) cases
in which the lines to be included in a list item begin with a
[non-whitespace character], and (b) cases in which
they begin with an indented code
block.  In a case like the following, where the first block begins with
a three-space indent, the rules do not allow us to form a list item by
indenting the whole thing and prepending a list marker:

```````````````````````````````` example
   foo

bar
.
<p>foo</p>
<p>bar</p>
````````````````````````````````


```````````````````````````````` example
-    foo

  bar
.
<ul>
<li>foo</li>
</ul>
<p>bar</p>
````````````````````````````````


This is not a significant restriction, because when a block begins
with 1-3 spaces indent, the indentation can always be removed without
a change in interpretation, allowing rule #1 to be applied.  So, in
the above case:

```````````````````````````````` example
-  foo

   bar
.
<ul>
<li>
<p>foo</p>
<p>bar</p>
</li>
</ul>
````````````````````````````````


3.  **Item starting with a blank line.**  If a sequence of lines *Ls*
    starting with a single [blank line] constitute a (possibly empty)
    sequence of blocks *Bs*, not separated from each other by more than
    one blank line, and *M* is a list marker of width *W*,
    then the result of prepending *M* to the first line of *Ls*, and
    indenting subsequent lines of *Ls* by *W + 1* spaces, is a list
    item with *Bs* as its contents.
    If a line is empty, then it need not be indented.  The type of the
    list item (bullet or ordered) is determined by the type of its list
    marker.  If the list item is ordered, then it is also assigned a
    start number, based on the ordered list marker.

Here are some list items that start with a blank line but are not empty:

```````````````````````````````` example
-
  foo
-
  ```
  bar
  ```
-
      baz
.
<ul>
<li>foo</li>
<li>
<pre><code>bar
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<pre><code>baz
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
````````````````````````````````

When the list item starts with a blank line, the number of spaces
following the list marker doesn't change the required indentation:

```````````````````````````````` example
-
  foo
.
<ul>
<li>foo</li>
</ul>
````````````````````````````````


A list item can begin with at most one blank line.
In the following example, `foo` is not part of the list
item:

```````````````````````````````` example
-

  foo
.
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>foo</p>
````````````````````````````````


Here is an empty bullet list item:

```````````````````````````````` example
- foo
-
- bar
.
<ul>
<li>foo</li>
<li></li>
<li>bar</li>
</ul>
````````````````````````````````


It does not matter whether there are spaces following the [list marker]:

```````````````````````````````` example
- foo
-
- bar
.
<ul>
<li>foo</li>
<li></li>
<li>bar</li>
</ul>
````````````````````````````````


Here is an empty ordered list item:

```````````````````````````````` example
1. foo
2.
3. bar
.
<ol>
<li>foo</li>
<li></li>
<li>bar</li>
</ol>
````````````````````````````````


A list may start or end with an empty list item:

```````````````````````````````` example
*
.
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
````````````````````````````````

However, an empty list item cannot interrupt a paragraph:

```````````````````````````````` example
foo
*

foo
1.
.
<p>foo
*</p>
<p>foo
1.</p>
````````````````````````````````


4.  **Indentation.**  If a sequence of lines *Ls* constitutes a list item
    according to rule #1, #2, or #3, then the result of indenting each line
    of *Ls* by 1-3 spaces (the same for each line) also constitutes a
    list item with the same contents and attributes.  If a line is
    empty, then it need not be indented.

Indented one space:

```````````````````````````````` example
 1.  A paragraph
     with two lines.

         indented code

     > A block quote.
.
<ol>
<li>
<p>A paragraph
with two lines.</p>
<pre><code>indented code
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>A block quote.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
````````````````````````````````


Indented two spaces:

```````````````````````````````` example
  1.  A paragraph
      with two lines.

          indented code

      > A block quote.
.
<ol>
<li>
<p>A paragraph
with two lines.</p>
<pre><code>indented code
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>A block quote.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
````````````````````````````````


Indented three spaces:

```````````````````````````````` example
   1.  A paragraph
       with two lines.

           indented code

       > A block quote.
.
<ol>
<li>
<p>A paragraph
with two lines.</p>
<pre><code>indented code
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>A block quote.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
````````````````````````````````


Four spaces indent gives a code block:

```````````````````````````````` example
    1.  A paragraph
        with two lines.

            indented code

        > A block quote.
.
<pre><code>1.  A paragraph
    with two lines.

        indented code

    &gt; A block quote.
</code></pre>
````````````````````````````````



5.  **Laziness.**  If a string of lines *Ls* constitute a [list
    item](#list-items) with contents *Bs*, then the result of deleting
    some or all of the indentation from one or more lines in which the
    next [non-whitespace character] after the indentation is
    [paragraph continuation text] is a
    list item with the same contents and attributes.  The unindented
    lines are called
    [lazy continuation line](@)s.

Here is an example with [lazy continuation lines]:

```````````````````````````````` example
  1.  A paragraph
with two lines.

          indented code

      > A block quote.
.
<ol>
<li>
<p>A paragraph
with two lines.</p>
<pre><code>indented code
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>A block quote.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
````````````````````````````````


Indentation can be partially deleted:

```````````````````````````````` example
  1.  A paragraph
    with two lines.
.
<ol>
<li>A paragraph
with two lines.</li>
</ol>
````````````````````````````````


These examples show how laziness can work in nested structures:

```````````````````````````````` example
> 1. > Blockquote
continued here.
.
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Blockquote
continued here.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
````````````````````````````````


```````````````````````````````` example
> 1. > Blockquote
> continued here.
.
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Blockquote
continued here.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
````````````````````````````````



6.  **That's all.** Nothing that is not counted as a list item by rules
    #1--5 counts as a [list item](#list-items).

The rules for sublists follow from the general rules
[above][List items].  A sublist must be indented the same number
of spaces a paragraph would need to be in order to be included
in the list item.

So, in this case we need two spaces indent:

```````````````````````````````` example
- foo
  - bar
    - baz
      - boo
.
<ul>
<li>foo
<ul>
<li>bar
<ul>
<li>baz
<ul>
<li>boo</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
````````````````````````````````


One is not enough:

```````````````````````````````` example
- foo
 - bar
  - baz
   - boo
.
<ul>
<li>foo</li>
<li>bar</li>
<li>baz</li>
<li>boo</li>
</ul>
````````````````````````````````


Here we need four, because the list marker is wider:

```````````````````````````````` example
10) foo
    - bar
.
<ol start="10">
<li>foo
<ul>
<li>bar</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
````````````````````````````````


Three is not enough:

```````````````````````````````` example
10) foo
   - bar
.
<ol start="10">
<li>foo</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>bar</li>
</ul>
````````````````````````````````


A list may be the first block in a list item:

```````````````````````````````` example
- - foo
.
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>foo</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
````````````````````````````````


```````````````````````````````` example
1. - 2. foo
.
<ol>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>foo</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
````````````````````````````````


A list item can contain a heading:

```````````````````````````````` example
- # Foo
- Bar
  ---
  baz
.
<ul>
<li>
<h1>Foo</h1>
</li>
<li>
<h2>Bar</h2>
baz</li>
</ul>
````````````````````````````````


### Motivation

John Gruber's Markdown spec says the following about list items:

1. "List markers typically start at the left margin, but may be indented
   by up to three spaces. List markers must be followed by one or more
   spaces or a tab."

2. "To make lists look nice, you can wrap items with hanging indents....
   But if you don't want to, you don't have to."

3. "List items may consist of multiple paragraphs. Each subsequent
   paragraph in a list item must be indented by either 4 spaces or one
   tab."

4. "It looks nice if you indent every line of the subsequent paragraphs,
   but here again, Markdown will allow you to be lazy."

5. "To put a blockquote within a list item, the blockquote's `>`
   delimiters need to be indented."

6. "To put a code block within a list item, the code block needs to be
   indented twice — 8 spaces or two tabs."

These rules specify that a paragraph under a list item must be indented
four spaces (presumably, from the left margin, rather than the start of
the list marker, but this is not said), and that code under a list item
must be indented eight spaces instead of the usual four.  They also say
that a block quote must be indented, but not by how much; however, the
example given has four spaces indentation.  Although nothing is said
about other kinds of block-level content, it is certainly reasonable to
infer that *all* block elements under a list item, including other
lists, must be indented four spaces.  This principle has been called the
*four-space rule*.

The four-space rule is clear and principled, and if the reference
implementation `Markdown.pl` had followed it, it probably would have
become the standard.  However, `Markdown.pl` allowed paragraphs and
sublists to start with only two spaces indentation, at least on the
outer level.  Worse, its behavior was inconsistent: a sublist of an
outer-level list needed two spaces indentation, but a sublist of this
sublist needed three spaces.  It is not surprising, then, that different
implementations of Markdown have developed very different rules for
determining what comes under a list item.  (Pandoc and python-Markdown,
for example, stuck with Gruber's syntax description and the four-space
rule, while discount, redcarpet, marked, PHP Markdown, and others
followed `Markdown.pl`'s behavior more closely.)

Unfortunately, given the divergences between implementations, there
is no way to give a spec for list items that will be guaranteed not
to break any existing documents.  However, the spec given here should
correctly handle lists formatted with either the four-space rule or
the more forgiving `Markdown.pl` behavior, provided they are laid out
in a way that is natural for a human to read.

The strategy here is to let the width and indentation of the list marker
determine the indentation necessary for blocks to fall under the list
item, rather than having a fixed and arbitrary number.  The writer can
think of the body of the list item as a unit which gets indented to the
right enough to fit the list marker (and any indentation on the list
marker).  (The laziness rule, #5, then allows continuation lines to be
unindented if needed.)

This rule is superior, we claim, to any rule requiring a fixed level of
indentation from the margin.  The four-space rule is clear but
unnatural. It is quite unintuitive that

``` markdown
- foo

  bar

  - baz
```

should be parsed as two lists with an intervening paragraph,

``` html
<ul>
<li>foo</li>
</ul>
<p>bar</p>
<ul>
<li>baz</li>
</ul>
```

as the four-space rule demands, rather than a single list,

``` html
<ul>
<li>
<p>foo</p>
<p>bar</p>
<ul>
<li>baz</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
```

The choice of four spaces is arbitrary.  It can be learned, but it is
not likely to be guessed, and it trips up beginners regularly.

Would it help to adopt a two-space rule?  The problem is that such
a rule, together with the rule allowing 1--3 spaces indentation of the
initial list marker, allows text that is indented *less than* the
original list marker to be included in the list item. For example,
`Markdown.pl` parses

``` markdown
   - one

  two
```

as a single list item, with `two` a continuation paragraph:

``` html
<ul>
<li>
<p>one</p>
<p>two</p>
</li>
</ul>
```

and similarly

``` markdown
>   - one
>
>  two
```

as

``` html
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>one</p>
<p>two</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
```

This is extremely unintuitive.

Rather than requiring a fixed indent from the margin, we could require
a fixed indent (say, two spaces, or even one space) from the list marker (which
may itself be indented).  This proposal would remove the last anomaly
discussed.  Unlike the spec presented above, it would count the following
as a list item with a subparagraph, even though the paragraph `bar`
is not indented as far as the first paragraph `foo`:

``` markdown
 10. foo

   bar
```

Arguably this text does read like a list item with `bar` as a subparagraph,
which may count in favor of the proposal.  However, on this proposal indented
code would have to be indented six spaces after the list marker.  And this
would break a lot of existing Markdown, which has the pattern:

``` markdown
1.  foo

        indented code
```

where the code is indented eight spaces.  The spec above, by contrast, will
parse this text as expected, since the code block's indentation is measured
from the beginning of `foo`.

The one case that needs special treatment is a list item that *starts*
with indented code.  How much indentation is required in that case, since
we don't have a "first paragraph" to measure from?  Rule #2 simply stipulates
that in such cases, we require one space indentation from the list marker
(and then the normal four spaces for the indented code).  This will match the
four-space rule in cases where the list marker plus its initial indentation
takes four spaces (a common case), but diverge in other cases.
